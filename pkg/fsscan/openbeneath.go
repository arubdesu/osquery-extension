// OpenBeneath opens relPath relative to baseDir while refusing to follow
// symlinks at ANY path component: including intermediates. This is
// equivalent to Linux's openat2(O_NOFOLLOW + RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS), built
// portably on macOS with iterated openat(O_NOFOLLOW).
//
// The threat this defends against: a user owns their home directory, so
// they can replace ANY intermediate directory with a symlink:
//
//	rm -rf ~/Library
//	ln -s /Users/victim/Library ~/Library
//
// Then a direct-path lookup like ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/foo.json
// resolves through the attacker's symlink to the victim's Library. Plain
// O_NOFOLLOW only protects the FINAL component. OpenBeneath protects all
// of them: each intermediate is opened with O_NOFOLLOW so a substituted
// symlink fails with ELOOP.
//
// baseDir is assumed already trusted (e.g., the result of ListUserHomes,
// which Lstat-checks user home dirs and refuses symlinks at /Users/*).
// relPath must NOT contain ".." or absolute path components: those are
// rejected. Components separated by OS path separators are walked one at
// a time.
//
// Returns an *os.File ready for reading, or an error. The caller closes the file as usual.
// The per-component open is platform-specific: platform_unix.go iterates openat(O_NOFOLLOW),
// platform_windows.go walks a chain of os.Root handles and Lstats each component to refuse a
// reparse point that stays inside the root, and platform_unsupported.go reports unsupported
// for everything else.
