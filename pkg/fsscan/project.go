// Reading a file at a path a client's configuration recorded, rather than at a path this
// package chose.
//
// The two are not the same problem. Every other path here is one the code names itself: a
// home from the roster, plus a relative path written down in Go source, so containment holds
// by construction. A *recorded* path came out of a configuration file a user controls -- the
// `projects` map in ~/.claude.json, the `folder` field in a VS Code workspace, the
// `[projects."..."]` tables in Codex's config.toml -- and it can name anything at all:
// another account's home, a UNC share, a remote development host, a directory that was
// deleted last week.
//
// So containment has to be established here rather than inherited. Doing it per caller was
// the alternative and it is the wrong shape: the checks below are easy to get subtly wrong
// (percent-decoding, a non-empty URL host, a ".." that Clean would collapse before anyone
// looked), and every caller wanting a project-local file needs all of them. One
// implementation, one place to fix, one place to test.

// The refusals containment and the project read can report, as sentinels so the caller can
// classify without reading a message that would carry the path back into a column.
