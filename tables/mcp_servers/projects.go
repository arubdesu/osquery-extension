// Where project-local configuration comes from, now that nothing walks the filesystem.
//
// The walk it replaces was wrong in three ways the review named and one it did not. It was
// nondeterministic: ~22 roots per home to depth 6 under a budget shared across every home, so
// the first account's source tree could exhaust the allowance and the rows a second account
// got depended on how big the first account's checkout was. It downloaded files: ~/Documents
// and ~/Desktop are iCloud-backed under "Optimise Mac Storage", and reading a dehydrated file
// is a network fetch, so an inventory query pulled a user's documents down. And it blocked:
// one dead automount, offline network home or Windows oplock stalled the walk and everything
// osquery had scheduled behind it.
//
// The fourth problem is the one that makes the replacement better rather than merely safer. A
// walk finds files; it does not find *configuration*. It cannot tell a project the user works
// in from a vendored copy of someone else's repository, and on this machine 39 of 51 rows from
// one client came from a plugin marketplace cache -- installable catalog entries, not servers
// anybody had enabled. The exclusions that fixed that were substring matches on paths,
// maintained by noticing each new cache directory after it polluted the table.
//
// Every client already keeps a list of the projects its user actually opened. Reading that
// list and probing known filenames inside each entry is bounded by the number of projects
// rather than by the size of the disk, deterministic because the list is a file, and immune
// to the catalog problem because a marketplace cache is not a project anyone opened.
//
// What it costs is stated plainly in the table README: a project the user has never opened in
// a participating client is invisible, and so is one recorded by a client this file has no
// lister for.

// maxProjects bounds how many recorded projects one client's list may contribute.
//
// Measured against this machine, which records 30 projects for Claude Code and about 30 for
// Codex. An order of magnitude above that is unreachable by ordinary use and still bounds the
// work: each project costs one component-wise open per project-rooted probe, so the cap is
// what keeps a config file someone has scripted into thousands of entries from turning a
// bounded read into an unbounded one.
//
// Exceeding it is reported rather than silently truncating, because a project list cut short
// is the same shape of loss the walk's truncation was and the whole point of this change is
// that such a loss is visible.

// claudeJSONMaxSize is the per-source cap for ~/.claude.json alone.
//
// MaxFileSize became load-bearing with this change, and raising it for one file is the
// narrowest available answer. Before, an oversized ~/.claude.json cost that account its
// claude_code rows. Now it also costs every project-local configuration for the account and
// the whole of the approval state, because the project list IS that file -- so one file's size
// decides whether an account has a project inventory at all.
//
// And the size is driven by something no operator can reason about. Measured on this machine:
// ~/.claude.json is 94,827 bytes, of which 43% is `cachedGrowthBookFeatures` -- the client's
// own feature-flag cache, which has nothing to do with configuration and grows on its own
// schedule.
//
// The cost of this number is real and worth stating: json.Unmarshal of a 4 MiB document
// allocates several times that, per account, per query, against the osquery watchdog. 4 MiB
// is roughly forty times the real file here, which leaves room for years of that cache
// without leaving room for an unbounded read.
//
// The structural fix is to stream the file with json.Decoder.Token(), skipping the values of
// every top-level key other than mcpServers and projects, and bounding on streamed bytes
// rather than on file size. Not done here, because it replaces the extractor rather than
// adjusting a constant.
const claudeJSONMaxSize = 4 << 20 // 4 MiB

// stripBOM removes a UTF-8 byte-order mark.
//
// Shared by the parse path and the project listers because both consume the same bytes and
// only one of them used to strip it: Go's encoding/json rejects a BOM outright, so a
// ~/.claude.json written by a Windows editor parsed for neither purpose, and the project
// list failed silently while the server list at least produced a warning row.

// development machine. Counts add; the other fields come from the first sighting, since a
