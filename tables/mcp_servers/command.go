// The `command` field of an MCP config is one JSON string holding either of two shapes:
//
//   - a path to the executable, spaces and all. Windows installs live under
//     `C:\Program Files\...`, and splitting that on whitespace reported the launcher of an
//     ordinary nodejs install as "Program", emptying every identity column with it.
//   - an invocation with its arguments embedded, which configs do write in the wild --
//     Cursor's mcp.json carries {"command": "uvx some-pkg@latest"} -- where the first token
//     is the launcher and the rest are arguments.
//
// The presence of an `args` array does not decide which: a spaced path appears with one, and
// an embedded invocation appears without one. So the shape is read from the field itself,
// and the array only decides who owns the arguments. That decision lives in one function,
// commandFieldsFor, and both the command_basename column and identity inference take their
// answer from it -- they used to decide separately, the column splitting on whitespace and
// inference splitting again on its own rules, which is how one config could report basename
// "Program" alongside package_manager "".

// containsWhitespace reports whether s holds any Unicode space character.
//
// Unicode-aware rather than a list of ASCII bytes, and every whitespace test in this file
// goes through it or through unicode.IsSpace directly. Two separate reasons:
//
//   - a split that knew only about " \t" let "node\n--api-key=AAAA..." through as one token,
//     because a config can JSON-encode a literal newline into the command field;
//   - an ASCII-only list disagreed with strings.Fields and strings.TrimSpace, which are
//     Unicode-aware, so a field separated by U+00A0 or U+2028 was seen as having no
//     whitespace at all. It was then returned whole, and the entire invocation -- flag,
//     secret and package -- landed in command_basename, which is the one thing that column
//     exists to prevent. A non-breaking space is what a copy-paste from documentation or a

// commandShapeOf classifies a command field that contains whitespace.
//
// Three independent pieces of evidence make it an invocation, any one of which is enough.
// Each exists because a real configuration shape fails without it:
//
//  1. The first token is a bare command name -- no separator and not rooted. `node
//     src/server.js`. A single relative path whose *first* component contained a space would
//     look the same, but a bare command followed by arguments is the documented quirk and
//     `My Dir/bin/tool` is not a shape these configs use.
//  2. The first token's filename is a launcher this table knows: `/usr/bin/node src/server.js`.
//  3. The text after the space begins with a dash, or is itself rooted. Neither can continue
//     a path: an option is not a path component, and a rooted path does not appear halfway
//     through another one. This keeps an unknown launcher's options out of command_basename
//     -- `/usr/bin/some-tool --flag` reports some-tool, not --flag.
//
// A separator-free tail was a fourth signal until review showed the cost: `C:\Tools\My
// Server.exe` is an ordinary executable -- `command` and `args` are separate structured
// fields, so a filename containing a space needs no quoting -- and that rule read it as the
// launcher "My". Dropping it costs nothing in the common case, because `C:\Program
// Files\...` has a separator after the space and is a path by that alone.
//
// With no invocation evidence the field is read as a path, but only when the path reading
// names a launcher this table knows -- `/Applications/My Server/bin/uvx`, `C:\Program
// Files\nodejs\npx.cmd`. Otherwise both readings fit and neither is reported.
//
// That last rule is what keeps arguments out of the column. Without it,
// `/opt/bin/mytool config/prod.json` read as a path and emitted "prod.json": an argument,
// and an opaque one that redact.String cannot recognise as anything. With it, no
// user-chosen string escapes through the path branch at all -- the only basenames it can
// produce are the fixed names in launcherIdentity. An unrecognised executable under
// `C:\Program Files\vendor\` reports nothing, which is the conservative half of the trade.
//
// What it does not bound is identity. `/opt/bin/mytool bin/npx` with an args array of
// ["-y", "pkg@1.2.3"] reports npx, pkg, 1.2.3 at high confidence, because once the launcher
// is read as npx the declared array is handed to the npx handler. If mytool was the real
// launcher, all four columns are wrong together, not just the name.
//
// That case is kept anyway, because it is the same branch as the one this whole file exists
// for: `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd` and `/Applications/My Server/bin/npx`, each with
// their own args array, are classified by exactly this rule and are indistinguishable from
// it -- see TestSpacedPathsAndLauncherCollisionsAreIndistinguishable, which asserts the two
// produce byte-identical rows. Both ways of hedging cost the common case rather than the
// contrived one: suppressing identity takes package_name and version off the most ordinary
// Windows configuration there is, and capping confidence leaves the columns but demotes
// those rows out of every `confidence = 'high'` query, which is the same information an
// administrator loses, by a different route. Without an args array the collision cannot
// reach high confidence at all, since there are then no arguments to attribute.
