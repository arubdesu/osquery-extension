// withoutStandingNotes drops the diagnostics a platform raises on every run whatever the test
// is about, so a test can assert what it is actually measuring.
//
// Two of them, one per platform, and neither is a defect:
//
// On Linux, a roster-level note. osquery's users table omits directory-served accounts unless
// an expensive option is set, and the table says so. Because a constrained query repeats that
// note under each requested username, it inflates filtered counts as well as unfiltered ones.
// Identified structurally rather than by matching the message: a roster-level row is the one
// whose source path is the users root, because there is no single home it belongs to.
//
// On Windows, one roaming-application-data note per account. Resolving that location reads
// the account's registry hive, and a fixture home is a temp directory with no hive and no
// SID, so the lookup fails and every fake account draws the row. Identified by identity with
// the constant the code emits, so improving the wording cannot silently stop the filter
// working. The alternative -- mocking the hive -- would mean the tests no longer exercise the
// resolution path they are wrapped around.
//
// Tests asserting exact row counts were written on macOS, where neither note exists, and
// failed elsewhere for reasons unrelated to their subject.
