// A positive grammar per column, which is the second thing the review asked for.
//
// The objection it answers is precise and correct. Redaction blocks *known* secret patterns:
// pkg/redact recognises issuer-prefixed token shapes and this package adds
// credential-named flag assignments. An opaque string with no recognisable structure matches
// none of them. So any column assembled from text a user typed can still carry a secret, and
// the table's own schema comment already admitted as much -- it listed `server_name`,
// `command_basename`, `source_path`, `package_name` and `env_keys` as residual risk and
// argued that narrowing one while five others kept the property would not be sound.
//
// That argument was right about the premise and wrong about the conclusion. Narrowing one
// column is unsound; narrowing all of them is the fix, and it is possible because each column
// has a format that real values obey:
//
//   - a command basename is a filename, so `API_KEY=xyz npx -y pkg` fails on the `=`;
//   - an environment variable name is a C identifier, so `TOKEN = abc123`'s value cannot
//     masquerade as a key;
//   - an endpoint's host is a hostname, so a DNS-embedded token fails structurally rather
//     than relying on redaction to recognise it;
//   - a package name and a version have published grammars already in this file.
//
// Two columns cannot be narrowed and are documented rather than pretended about.
// `source_path` is a filesystem path whose directory names a user chooses, and an allowlist
// of directory names is not a thing that exists; it keeps redaction plus a structural
// assertion. `user` is an OS-supplied join key and constraining it would break
// `WHERE user = ...`, which is the query this table exists to answer.
//
// Each gate reports what it dropped. A column that is empty because the value did not match
// is not the same as a column that is empty because the config said nothing, and the
// difference is the whole reason this table has a warning column.

// commandBasenameRe is the format of an executable filename.
//
// Leading-alphanumeric is stricter than the `^[A-Za-z0-9._+-]+$` the review suggested, which
// would admit `-foo` -- a value beginning with a dash is an option, not a program, and
// admitting one means admitting the shape a misparsed command line produces.
//
// Checked against the real basenames on the machine this was developed on, including the two
// the schema comment cited as the reason an allowlist was rejected: `terraform-mcp-server`
// and `computer-use-client-launcher` both pass, as do `npx`, `uvx`, `atlassian.sh`,
// `npx.cmd`, `node` and `python3`. The argument that an allowlist would gut the column
// assumed an allowlist of *names*; this is an allowlist of the format a name has.
//
// What it loses, stated rather than buried: a non-ASCII basename is dropped. Admitting
// Unicode letters reopens homoglyph confusion -- `nрx` with a Cyrillic er is a different
// program that reads as `npx` in any console -- and for a column an operator scans by eye
// that is a worse failure than a missing value.

// could not have been doing the job the column describes.
//
